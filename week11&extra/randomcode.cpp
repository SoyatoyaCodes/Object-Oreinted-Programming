// Write a recursive method writeChars() that accepts an integer parameter n and that prints out n
// characters as follows. The middle character of the output should always be an asterisk ("*"). If you are
// asked to write out an even number of characters, then there will be two asterisks in the middle ("**").
// Before the asterisk(s) you should write out less-than characters (’<’). After the asterisk(s) you should
// write out greater-than characters (’>’). See the following for some example calls along with the output.
