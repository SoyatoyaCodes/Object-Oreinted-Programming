// Task 3:  
// Percentage Problem using Abstract Classes 
// We have to calculate the percentage of marks obtained in three subjects (each out of 100) by student A and 
// in four subjects (each out of 100) by student B. Create an abstract class 'Marks' with a pure virtual 
// method 'getPercentage()'. It is inherited by two other classes 'A' and 'B', each having a method 
// with the same name that returns the percentage of the students. 
// The constructor of student A takes the marks in three subjects as its parameters and the marks in four 
// subjects as its parameters for student B. Create an object for each of the two classes and print the 
// percentage of marks for both the students.
